# Simple Network Scanner

## Objective
Created a simple network scanner using Python and Nmap with options for target IPs, ports, and nMap scripts.

### Skills Learned

**1. Networking Concepts:**

* **Port Scanning Techniques:**  Learning various port scanning methods (TCP SYN, UDP, connect, etc.) and their implications for stealth and accuracy.
* **Service & Version Detection:**  Understanding how Nmap identifies services running on open ports and determines their versions.
* **Network Security Fundamentals:**  Developing awareness of network vulnerabilities and how port scanning plays a role in security assessments.

**2. Nmap Library Usage:**

* **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE):**  Exploring the power of NSE for extending Nmap's capabilities and customizing scans.
* **Nmap Output Parsing:**  Processing Nmap's XML output to extract relevant information and present it in a user-friendly format.


### Tools Used
